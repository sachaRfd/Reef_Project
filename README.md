# Reef_Generator Project

## Scripts:
- Create_Images: Takes filepath to the Sentinel Image data as input then creates images with different bands.
- Download_Files: Takes coordinates as input and downloads data, if available.
- Get_Individual_Reef: Takes path to RGB image and creates images of all the reefs present in that image.
    - This function has some bugs, Not sure how to fix yet --> Happens when the reefs are very small I think --> More work to be done.
